    <a name="subject_authentication"><h2>Subject Authentication</h2></a>

The {@link TlsRMIClientSocketFactory} and {@link TlsRMIServerSocketFactory} 
socket creation methods authenticate as a single {@link java.security.Principal} 
if the following items are present in the {@link javax.security.auth.Subject} 
at the time of socket creation for the establishment of secure connections and
control access to the {@link java.rmi.registry.Registry} to secure Phoenix
Activation when: <p>

<ul>
<li> One or more principals of type <code>X500Principal</code>
<li> For each principal, one or more certificate chains, stored as
     public credentials, and represented by instances of {@link
     java.security.cert.CertPath}, whose <code>getType</code> method
     returns "X.509", and for which calling <code>getSubjectDN</code> on
     the certificate chain's first element returns that principal's name
<li> For each certificate chain, an instance of {@link
     javax.security.auth.x500.X500PrivateCredential}, stored as a
     private credential, whose <code>getCertificate</code> method
     returns a value equal to the first element of the certificate
     chain, and whose <code>getPrivateKey</code> method returns the
     associated private key
</ul> <p>
    
These RMISocketFactory's are not for use as standard JRMP Endpoint's,
they are final and not Serializable.

These have been designed to secure the {@link java.rmi.registry.Registry}, for
Phoenix's configuration options and parameters to {@link java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry} 
methods.

These secure sockets require client authentication, anonymous client authentication
is vulnerable to deserialization gadget attacks.

Invocations by the client on the server endpoint will not be populated the 
server's thread with the client's subject.  

The <a
href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Customization"
target="_top">JSSE documentation</a> also describes the system
properties for configuring the location, type, and password of the
truststore that the SocketFactory's use, through JSSE, to make decisions about
what certificate chains should be trusted. <p>
